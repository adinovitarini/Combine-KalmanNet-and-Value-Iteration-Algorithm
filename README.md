# Tutorial 
1. Open file 'main.m' in MATLAB 
2. Choose the system you would try
3. The system's model was defined from system identification process using Recurrent Neural Network scheme. If you would like to do it by your owm, you could use the dataset from this reporsitory (data_distillate.csv for 1st study case and data_motor.csv for 2nd study case)
